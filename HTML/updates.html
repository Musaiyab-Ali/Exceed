        <p>Created description section and created business inquiry section. When hovering over business inquiry items,
        the items will turn blue. Organized css code for slightly easier read. Changed css code for h2. H2 is now called loginPage-container. It will
        only affect the designated orange block instead of targeting all h2 elements. Added font weight of bold to userIdLabel and passwordLabel.</p>
